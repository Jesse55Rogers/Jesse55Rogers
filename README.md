## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi there! I'm a backend engineer focused on caching strategies and performance optimization. This repository serves as a personal lab where I explore techniques to make backend systems faster, more efficient, and more scalable.

Performance is critical in modern applications, and I enjoy digging into the backend layers to uncover bottlenecks and fine-tune how data flows through a system. Lately, I’ve been working with tools and patterns that help reduce latency, lower server load, and improve response times across various types of applications.

This repo includes experiments and implementations around in-memory caching (like Redis and Memcached), HTTP caching, database query optimization, and code-level profiling. I’m also exploring cache invalidation strategies, TTL management, and patterns like cache-aside and write-through. My goal is to understand not just how these techniques work, but when and why to apply them in real-world scenarios.

Along the way, I'm building reusable code snippets, documenting best practices, and testing configurations that balance performance with consistency and scalability. Whether it’s optimizing API response times, reducing redundant queries, or improving throughput under load—this repo is all about pushing systems to perform better.

Everything here reflects what I’m actively learning, refining, or experimenting with. I hope it can serve as a useful resource for others interested in backend performance or looking for practical caching patterns.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or start a discussion—I'm always open to learning from others and collaborating on performance challenges.

Thanks for checking it out—and keep things fast and efficient! ⚡🛠️🚀
